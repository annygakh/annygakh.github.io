### How to retrieve a service as a singleton and return it to js consumers
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Language_Bindings/Components.classes

Last night I was thinking about how to retrieve a service and return it to the js consumer, and then I remembered `getService(...)` method. It is a method defined on `Components.classes` and it retrieves a service as a singleton. [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Language_Bindings/Components.classes) you can learn more about `Components.classes`.

Upon doing a search in searchfox.org, one can see that there are at least two definitions of `getService`, one in `xpcjsid.id` and one in `nsIServiceManager.idl`.  The implementation of the one in `nsIServiceManager.idl` did not seem useful because it did not deal with any JS runtime objects. So I looked at the implementation of the one in `xpcjsid.id` and it did deal with JS objects. Furthermore, since `Components.classes` is an object that implements `nsIJSCID` interface, we can rest assured knowing that that's the right place to look at.

**11:48 AM**
I am in the middle of writing codegen logic, but it own't compile because I am getting the following error
```
0:06.12 ~/src/mozilla-central/obj-opt/dist/include/mozilla/Services.h:493:1: error: unused function 'JSScriptloaderServiceGetter' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
0:06.12 JSScriptloaderServiceGetter(JSContext* aCx, unsigned aArgc, JS::Value* aVp);

```



### Back to Clipboard
I run full tests, and here are the tests that are failing
