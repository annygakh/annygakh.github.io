# Hiding old Services object and exposing the one generated via template
So I have added all services from `Services.jsm` to `Services.py`
and firefox has compiled successfully, but one of the errors I get upon starting
Firefox is that `Services.search` is undefined. I define `Services.search` if MOZ_TOOLKIT_SEARCH is defined. But it seems as though MOZ_TOOLKIT_SEARCH is not defined, even though it's needed. Let's try to figure out how to define it.

I found [this code bit](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/033d45ca70ff32acf04286244644d19308c359d5/toolkit/modules/moz.build#319-325).
```
for var in ('MOZ_TOOLKIT_SEARCH',
            'MOZ_SYSTEM_NSS',
            'MOZ_UPDATER',
            'MOZ_ANDROID_MOZILLA_ONLINE',
            'MOZ_SWITCHBOARD'):
    if CONFIG[var]:
        DEFINES[var] = True
```
So I added the following to `xpcom/build/moz.build`
```
for var in ('MOZ_TOOLKIT_SEARCH',
            'MOZ_CRASHREPORTER',
            'MOZ_GECKO_PROFILER',
            'ANDROID'):
    if CONFIG[var]:
        DEFINES[var] = True
```
because all of the above are mentioned in `Services.jsm`.

# Services.blocklist.pluginQueries

I am running firefox, and while most of the things are working, I am getting the following error in the console:
```
... TypeError: Services.blocklist.pluginQueries is undefined (resource://gre/modules/Blocklist.jsm:310:1) JS Stack trace: _init@Blocklist.jsm:310:1
```
So turns out `Blocklist` service, similar to `CrashManager`is also defined in JavaScript.
I need to figure out how to expose it to C++.

Next steps and observations
- Searching for `"@mozilla.org/extensions/blocklist;1"` in cpp files shows that when a service is retrieved using the above contract id, it is treated as `nsIBlocklistService`.
- There is a header file for `nsIBlocklistService` class
- So this service defined from JavaScript gets exposed to C++ somehow, so I should be able to figure out just from searching for `blocklist` or for `nsIBlocklistService`
- There is this [`extensions.manifest`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/033d45ca70ff32acf04286244644d19308c359d5/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/extensions.manifest#7) file, and I am not sure if I need this as well
  - I could check if there is `extensions.manifest`
- Nevermind. I think what's important here is that it seems that C++ code can use do_GetService to obtain `nsIBlocklistService`.
- So it seems like we are obtaining Blocklist service correctly, but not all of the expected methods are exposed
- Do we need to query for another interface perhaps? Let's see. Need to search for `pluginQueries`
- Why is `Blocklist` defined in several places?
  - I looked at the blame of both files, and traced the creation of the second `Blocklist` definition back to this [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1456677).
  - So it seems like `Blocklist.jsm` is just a stub
- I think there are two problems at this point
  1. `Services.blocklist.pluginQueries` is not defined, and I think perhaps that due to
  the field not being specified in the interface in the `idl` files
  2. `Services.blocklist.isLoaded` returns false when I comment out the old Service object and use mine, and returns true when the old Service object is used globally
- Let's first figure out #2. `Cu.isModuleLoaded(BLOCKLIST_JSM)` returns false, so I guess we are not loading it properly when we are exposing it via C++.
- Summary of the problem so far: Blocklist service is not defined purely in `Blocklist.jsm`. What we have in `Blocklist.jsm` is only a stub, and the real implementation is located in `toolkit/mozapps/extensions/addonManager.js`. The real implementation also contains some fields that are not exposed through `idl`. Should we go ahead and
- Update, so my mentor said I should be using WrappedJsObject instead.

# Update to my code generator
- Child process message manager does not need custom service retrieval and can be
retrieved in the same way as others, even though it is exposed via `webidl`
- Defines are available at build time, so already in the python script I can choose not to generate certain service getters
- To be continued tomorrow...
