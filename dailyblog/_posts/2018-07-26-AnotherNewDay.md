I am realizing my blog posts don't look very nice outside of my editor's markdown preview,
so I will try to fix that soon. My apologies :)

### Things I need to figure out
- How to define lazy getters for services that implement more than one interface
  - Currently I am struggling with getting a 'tear off' of the object
- How to export a javascript service in an object
