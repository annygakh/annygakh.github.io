This page contains my daily posts. They are pretty informal, sometimes incohesive and might contain typos.
They usually act as my thought dump, sometimes containing my hour-by-hour thoughts as
I am struggling through a technical problem. 

They also act as a collection of hacks I have learned
or small guides for doing things, e.g. 'How to setup the rr debugger' or 'How to do X in git'. 

From time to time I will extract bits and pieces from these posts to make one long and cohesive long post,
which you will see in the 'long posts' section.
