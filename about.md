About me
------
I used to work on the Firefox browser engine at Mozilla from 2019 - 2022. I have completed my Computer Science Bachelor of Science program at UBC in May 2019. I have previously interned at Monexa, Nvidia and Mozilla. This blog is me rambling about what I work on. There are hacks, code tidbits, explanations and my thoughts in progress.


*All opinions are my own and my own only.*
